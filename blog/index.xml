      <description>Introduction About a week ago I started learning about K8s. Soon a learned that there are plenty possibilties to run a cluster yourself online (katacoda, play-with-k8s) but I also learned many people installed it themselves on a Raspberry Pi cluster. Challenge accepted!
Below I&amp;rsquo;ll describe why and how I did this (so far). Please note that I am still learning about K8s as well as Ansible, so it could well be that there are other or better ways to do this.</description>
